          <p>
            Concrete plays an essential role in the architecture and sustainability of the ASU Tempe campus. 
            Concrete materials, including structural and decorative types, are untilized all over campus and contribute to 
            the university's experience for students, faculty, and visitors. Many people do but notice the prevelance and importance of 
            concrete in their daily lives at ASU, but learning more about it will allow for a greater appreciation of this versatile material 
            as well as the university and its history.
