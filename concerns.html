    <h2>Material Concerns</h2>
    <p>
      Concrete materials can face a variety of concerns including cracking, discoloration, and more. 
      While concrete is a durable material, it is often affected by environmental factors such as moisture, temperature changes, and uneven settling. 
      Concrete materials handle compression well but can crack under tension or heavy loads if not properly reinforced. 
      Learning more about these concerns can help to identify and address potential safety issues on the ASU Tempe campus.

          <h3>Improper Jointing</h3>
          <img src="crack1.jpg" alt="Cracked Concrete" style="width:100%; max-width:300px; max-height:200px; object-fit:cover;">
          <p>
            Joints, the lines cut into concrete to control cracking, must be properly spaced and placed to ensure long-term durability. 
            This image shows a walkway where joints were not properly added around the cover, leading to a large crack in the sidewalk.

          <h3>Discoloration</h3>
          <img src="crack2.jpg" alt="Cracked Concrete" style="width:100%; max-width:300px; max-height:200px; object-fit:cover;">
          <p>When concrete is repaired, the new concrete may not match the existing material in color or texture, leading to an anaesthetic appearance. 
            While this does not affect the durability of the concrete, ensuring all concrete meets strength and structual needs when it is placed will mitigate this issue.

          <h3>Improper Repairs</h3>
          <img src="crack3.jpg" alt="Cracked Concrete" style="width:100%; max-width:300px; max-height:200px; object-fit:cover;">
          <p>When concrete is repaired, the new concrete must be propertly jointed and bonded with the preexisting concrete to ensure long-term durability. 
            This new concrete was not correctly bonded, leading to further cracking and deterioration as well as cracking due to the improper depth of the joints.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Can cracking be prevented completely?</dt>
          <dd>No, even perfectly mixed and placed concrete may crack. 
            However, proper techniques like using control joints, good curing practices, and proper reinforcement can reduce cracking.</dd>

          <dt>What causes cracks to get bigger over time?</dt>
          <dd>Cracking can worsen over time due to temperature changes, heavy loads, mousture, soil movement, and poor drainage.
