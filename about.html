    <h2>How is concrete made?</h2>
    <p>
      Concrete is made by mixing cement, water, and aggregates such as sand or gravel together. 
      The mixture is then undergoes a chemical reaction called hydration, which allows the convcrete to harden over time and gain strength. 
      Cement acts as the glue that holds concrete together, but can also contain pozzolanic materials such as fly ash or shale, shown in the table below. 
      These pozzolans improve concrete strength and durability as well as provide a sustainable use for byproducts from other industries. 
      Once concrete is poured, it must be property cured and tested to ensure it meets the necessary strength requirements for the project.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>How long does it take for concrete to cure?</dt>
          <dd>Concrete sets within a few hours of being poured but the final strength of concrete is measured at 28 days.</dd>

          <dt>Why does concrete have different strengths?</dt>
          <dd>Concrete strength is determined by a variety of factors including the water-to-cement ratio, curing, and aggregates.
            Hiher strength concrete is more expensive and used for specific projects such as bridges or high-rise buildings while lower strength
            concrete is used for sidealks or driveways.
